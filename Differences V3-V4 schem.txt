DCMI_PDWN: MCU end
- V4: connects to PD7
- V3: connects to PB5

DCMI_FSIN/ FSIN:
- V4: Called 'DCMI_FSIN' (same name at MCU and connector)
- V3: Called 'FSIN' (same name at MCU and connector)

Power connections for camera direct mount
are more complex than for the connector used on MV4

DCMI_D(0:7):
- Difficult to check if these end up connected to same pins of camera
- Assume they do so that software didn't haven't to be changed from V3-V4 
- Can possibly find schematic for separate camera chip used on MV4 to confirm

PA15, PB3, PB4, PB5 on MV4, are different to MV3
only PB5 (DCMI_PWDN) appears to affect the camera module though
