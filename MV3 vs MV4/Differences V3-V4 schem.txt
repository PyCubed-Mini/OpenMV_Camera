DCMI_PDWN: MCU end
- V4: connects to PD7
- V3: connects to PB5

SPI3_SSEL:
- V4: Goes from PA15 on MCU to pin 11 on connector
- V3: Doesn't exist on V3/not used

SPI3_SSCLK/TRACESWO:
- V4: From PB3 to pin 13 on connector

SPI3_MISO:
- V4: From PB4 to connector pin 15

SPI3_MOSI:
- V4: From PB5 to connector pin 17


DCMI_FSIN/ FSIN:
- V4: Called 'DCMI_FSIN' (same name at MCU and connector)
- V3: Called 'FSIN' (same name at MCU and connector)

Power connections for camera direct mount
are more complex than for the connector used on MV4

DCMI_D(0:7):
- Difficult to check if these end up connected to same pins of camera
- Assume they do so that software didn't haven't to be changed from V3-V4 
- Can possibly find schematic for separate camera chip used on MV4 to confirm

PA15, PB3, PB4, PB5 on MV4, are different to MV3 as stated above
Unclear whether the SPI's affect the camera module and why v4 needs them.
