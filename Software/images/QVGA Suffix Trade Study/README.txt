At one point, there was interest in exploring alternative image file formats ("suffices") to see if it was possible to improve image quality in this way.  Unfortunately, for VGA-style images, JPG is the only supported format.  Thus, for posterity,this study includes images saved in different file formats for QVGA-style photos, not VGA-style photos.

Conclusion:
- JPG is the only viable image format for this project.
