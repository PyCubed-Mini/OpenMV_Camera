This preparation delay trade study was intended to be an automatic "blindness" trade study, whose results could be produced with a single code.
Unfortunately, "blindness" is only experienced upon wakeup, so only the first image in this study was subjected to "blindness."

Ignore this study in favor of "Manual Blindness Trade."
