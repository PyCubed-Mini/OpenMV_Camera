This processing delay trade study was intended to be an automatic trade study, whose results could be produced with a single code.

Unfortunately, this is not true to the real experiment, as the camera will actually be shut off or made to sleep after each image.

Preliminary results suggest that a processing time of at least 2000 ms should be sufficient.

A new, more accurate, manual trade study should be coming out soon.
