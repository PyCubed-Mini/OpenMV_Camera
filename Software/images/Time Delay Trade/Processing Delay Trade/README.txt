This processing delay trade study was intended to be an automatic trade study, whose results could be produced with a single code.

Unfortunately, this is not true to the real experiment, as the camera will actually be shut off or made to sleep after each image.

Preliminary results suggest that a processing time of at least 2000 ms should be sufficient.

A new, more accurate, manual trade study should be coming out soon.

UPDATE:

The manual trade study yielded the same results as the automatic trade study, suggesting that the former was, in fact, satisfactorily accurate, and that processing delays as low as 10 ms can be acceptable.  For security, processing delays on the order of 100 ms or 500 ms are recommended.
